                    Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by English mathematician John Conway in 1970. This is a game without players, in which a person creates an initial state, and then only observes its development. The game can create Turing-complete processes, which makes it possible to implement any Turing machine.

                    The place of action of the game is a plane marked into cells, which can be unlimited, limited or closed.
                    Each cell on this surface has eight neighbors surrounding it, and can be in two states: be alive or dead
                    The distribution of living cells at the beginning of the game is called the first generation. Each next generation is calculated based on the previous one according to the following rules:
                    <br><br><b>1.</b> In an empty cell, which is adjacent to three living cells, life is born
                    <br><b>2.</b> If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, then this cell continues to live
                    <br><b>3.</b> The game ends if not a single living cell will remain on the field
                    <br><b>4.</b> The configuration at the next step will exactly repeat itself at one of the earlier steps
                    <br><b>5.</b> At the next step, none of the cells changes its state
